# SuspensionDataProject
Personally project to make my own suspension acquisition device for my bicycle

Not very far at all in this project, currently I have done:
- acquired a linear encoder to get positional data
- got an arduino
- connected the linear encoder to my arduino
- wrote an arduino program to output the data from the encoder to the serial output

The to do list:
- figure out a way to get the data from the arduino to my phone
- write an iphone app to display the data on a time versus movement graph
- figure out a way to connect the encoder and arduino to my bicycle

End goal of the project:
To have an iphone app which can display on a graph in real time the movement of my bicycles suspension.
I only know currently that will allow me to accurately set the rebound setting on my suspension.  This can be achieved by looking at the oscillations in the graph.
